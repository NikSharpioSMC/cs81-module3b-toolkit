//This is a simple toolkit for basic math functions

After all functions are complete, create a REFLECTION.md file:
1Q) What patterns or surprises did you notice?
1A) Thhe pattern is that the function returns with a argument followed by an arithmetic and the math function.
2Q) What logic challenged your thinking?
2A) The logic that challenged my thinking is the instruction on what to do. The instructions are not specific enough as to what type of function or if we need to initial a variable.
3Q) How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?
3A) This toolkit is very useful as it can't used as snippet or a reminder for simple recollection.
